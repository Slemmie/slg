# slg - VM

### Running slg source code using a virtual machine
A virtual machine written in C will:
-  ompile slg source code to '.o' files (these can only be interpreted by the VM)
- Link .o files and create an "executable" (which can only be run inside the VM)
- Run any slg "executable" inside the VM

### Usage
...

### Later
There might be a bootstrap version of the VM approach later
